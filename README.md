# Overwatch-Reddit-Skimmer

This really simple web page allows you to skim through recent posts from the Overwatch subreddit, allowing you to get an idea of what people are talking about every day in a short time. 

In this web page, the titles and content previews of recent 10 posts are displayed. 

I believe you can easily tell which ones are titles which ones are previews.

How to use the web page: scroll.
